# DHT11-Temparature-Humidity-Sensor
This Arduino code reads temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor and displays it on a 16x2 LCD screen using the LiquidCrystal_I2C library. Additionally, a buzzer module is used to provide audible feedback, particularly in cases where sensor readings fail.
